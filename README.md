Project Name: Cyber Threat Detection API  

Description:
This is a Flask-based Cyber Threat Detection API that performs phishing detection and anomaly detection using machine learning. The API analyzes suspicious emails, URLs, and system logs to identify potential security threats. It is deployed on Render for free, allowing real-time threat classification.

Key Features:
✅ Phishing Detection – Uses NLP to scan emails and URLs for phishing attempts.
✅ Anomaly Detection – ML model detects unusual cybersecurity activities in logs.
✅ REST API – Flask backend handles classification requests.
✅ Deployed on Render – Easily accessible via a public URL.
✅ Scalable & Free – Hosted on Render’s free tier with automatic deployment from GitHub.

How It Works:
1️⃣ Send a request with an email, URL, or log entry.
2️⃣ The API analyzes it using ML models.
3️⃣ It returns a classification (e.g., "Phishing", "Safe", "Anomalous Activity").
4️⃣ The results can be integrated into security systems or displayed on a Tableau dashboard.
